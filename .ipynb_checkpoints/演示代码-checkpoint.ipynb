    "Above we are creating a kind of summary dashboard, where we collect relevant visualisations to study the distributions of the individual features. We use the matplotlib *subplot* tool to line up the individual plots in a grid. We use overlapping histograms for ordinal features and barplots for categorical features.

However, it's noticeable that fewer young adults have survived (ages 18 - 30-ish) whereas **children younger than 10-ish had a better survival rate.** Also, there are no obvious outliers that would indicate problematic input data. The highest ages are well consistent with the overall distribution. There is a notable shortage of teenagers compared to the crowd of younger kids. But this could have natural reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Pclass:* There's a clear trend that **being a 1st class passenger gives you better chances of survival**. Life just isn't fair.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *SibSp & Parch:* **Having 1-3 siblings/spouses/parents/children on board (SibSp = 1-2, Parch = 1-3) suggests proportionally better survival numbers than being alone (SibSp + Parch = 0) or having a large family travelling with you.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Embarked:* Well, that does look more interesting than expected.  **Embarking at \"C\" resulted in a higher survival rate than embarking at \"S\"**. There might be a correlation with other variables, here though.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Fare:* This is case where a linear scaling isn't of much help because there is a smaller number of more extreme numbers. A natural choice in this case is to transform the values logarithmically. For this to work we need to adjust for the zero-fare entries.  The plot tells us that the **survival chances were much lower for the cheaper cabins**. Naively, one would assume that those cheap cabins were mostly located deeper inside the ship, i.e. further away from the life boats."
